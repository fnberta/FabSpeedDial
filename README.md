# FabSpeedDial
Simple library that implements the Floating Action Button Speed Dial pattern. It uses components from the Google design support library.

NOTE: I created this lib for usage in one of my projects. It is very limited and focused on what I needed in the project. Use at your own risk!

# Usage
Check the sample project to see how to use it. If you think something is missing, let me know and I will try to add it.
